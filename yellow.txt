# setup for each project (git)
# git init to create reop (railes does this for you)
# create a repo on github
# add the remote link to the repo (remenber to use the ssh link)

# basic flow
# make change in your code
# add(stage) those changes (git add . or git add filename)
# commit those changes (git commit -m'Description of what you did')

# Push step: when needed
# pull from github(if needed)
# fix any conflicts if they exist
# push up to github

# if working with a partner
# onw of you will create the repo, the other will clone

# when a team member pushes to master, they should tell everyone to 
# pull from master (ie git pull origin master)
